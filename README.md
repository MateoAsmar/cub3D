## Overview

cub3D is a raycasting engine project written in C that simulates a 3D environment from a 2D mapâ€”reminiscent of classic first-person shooters. In this project, I implemented the core engine along with several bonus features including a real-time minimap, robust wall collision detection, and smooth mouse-controlled camera movement.

## Features

- **Raycasting Engine:** Renders a 3D view using raycasting techniques based on a 2D map.
- **Minimap Bonus:** Displays an overhead view of the map that updates dynamically as the player moves.
- **Wall Collision Detection Bonus:** Prevents the player from moving through walls, ensuring realistic navigation.
- **Mouse Movement Bonus:** Allows smooth, intuitive player rotation using mouse input.
- **42 Norm Compliance:** All code adheres strictly to the 42 coding standards.

## Project Details

- **Language:** C  
- **Dependencies:**  
  - MiniLibX (MLX) for graphics rendering  
  - Standard C libraries (math, system calls, etc.)
- **Compilation:**  
  The project is compiled with the flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`
- **Testing:**  
  Extensively tested to ensure reliable rendering, responsive controls, and accurate collision detection.

## Usage

***To compile cub3D:***
```bash
make
```

***To run the project:***
```bash
./cub3D path_to_map.cub
```
Replace `path_to_map.cub` with the path to your map configuration file.

## What I Learned
Working on cub3D was both challenging and highly rewarding. Throughout the project, I deepened my understanding of:

- **Raycasting Algorithm:** Implementing the logic that converts a 2D map into a 3D visual experience.

- **Low-Level Graphics Programming:** Gaining hands-on experience with MLX for rendering and handling real-time updates.

- **Collision Detection:** Developing robust mechanisms to prevent the player from passing through walls.

- **Advanced Input Handling:** Integrating mouse input for smooth camera rotation and enhancing user interaction.

- **Code Optimization & Norm Compliance:** Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code under strict guidelines.

## Conclusion
cub3D not only replicates a classic 3D rendering engine but also pushes the boundaries by incorporating advanced bonus features. This project has been instrumental in enhancing my skills in C programming, algorithm optimization, and interactive graphics. It stands as a testament to my ability to solve complex problems while adhering to rigorous coding standards.
